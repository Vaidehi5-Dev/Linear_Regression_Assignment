## General Information

- We are using multiple linear regression
- Solving boom bikes sales problem by predicting the sales using various factors
- Boombikes rental data set is used here

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- We got R squared value as 82.7% for test set and 81.1% for train set which are similar and it shows that our model explains the variance correctly.
- Mean squared error is almost 0 for both training and test sets hence our model is predicting accuratley.
